# Name : Ivaylo Nikolov
# Role : System administrator
# Learning Goals : With several years of experience as a System/Application Administrator, I’ve worked closely with development teams to manage and support tools used in DevOps environments. My goal is to deep dive into the DevOps culture, focusing on automating manual processes, improving system efficiency, and expanding my technical skills to better understand and apply DevOps practices. That’s why I believe this upskill program is the right opportunity to build and develop the expertise I need to grow in this direction.
